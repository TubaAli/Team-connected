# README

The app has a basic CRUD principle where we can create, read, update, and destroy posts. I have used a gem named devise to make an entire user role and authentication system easy. Postgresql is used as database and bulma for UI part.  

Usage: This app is created to keep your teams connected. 
I have temporarily deployed it on Heroku at https://team-connected.herokuapp.com/.
